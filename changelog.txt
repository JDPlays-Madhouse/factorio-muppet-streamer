Version: 20.0.16
Date: 2022-03-04
  Features:
    - Pants On Fire - Added optional Flame Count option that affects how much damage and the burn time of each fire entity. Defaults to 20 which is the minimum for a tree to catch on fire.
    - Call For Help - Added optional Same Surface Only option to allow calling players from other surfaces. Useful for some scenarios. Defaults to true (as per old behaviour).
    - Call For Help - Added optional blacklisted and whitelisted player name lists to refine which players can be teleported to help.
  Changes:
    - Call For Help - Changed callRadius is now optional and if left undefined will call players from unlimited distance away. Saves having to provide a very large number for these scenarios and is the default.
  Bugfixes:
    - Creating random trees on tiles without specific climate data no longer errors. If the player can walk on the tile they get a random tree, if they can't it gets no tree.
    - Call For Help intermittent error fixed when multiple players trying to be teleported in to a difficult to place situation. Bug reports indicated this was related to being in trains, but not the case.
  Info:
    - Readme text for Teleport and Call For Help clarified in places. No functional changes, but additional pre-existing exceptions are now listed.
