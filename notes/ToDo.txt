Can you spawn trees and use radius as the amount so it just fills in a circle around the player? Have a configurable density of trees.

I'd do them popping up and probably also offer rocks, lasers, turrets with ammo types
or i'd have an option: circle permimiter with x number , circle randomly filled with X number , filled in circle with X density
as it would be quantity and radius of perimitier, rather than randomly within the area
