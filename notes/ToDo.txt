DOING NOW:



BUGS:
    - Suspect Aggressive Driver ignores vehicles that don't burn any fuel. As it just checks if there is currently fuel and ignores if it needs fuel. Probably need the utility function that gets fuel to also return if the entity needs fuel (has a burner).



DO NEAR FUTURE:
	- CONCEPT: Make Remote Interface calls return the things they create if appropriate. Means you can chain them together in a Lua script. This should just need the odd entry in a features "notes" and an entry in the generic Remote Interface section to check each command. For affected players it should return the players who were/are affected, i.e. if a player isn't affected by aggressive driver then nil is return, rather than the LuaPlayer object. THIS WON'T WORK AS WE DELAY THE FIRING OF ALL COMMANDS (EVEN DELAY 0), SO THE REMOTE'S RETURN THE ACTION HASN'T BEEN DONE. NEED TO EITHER MAKE DELAY 0 RUN IMMEDIATELY (AND ONLY OFFER THIS ON THAT), NOT OFFER THIS, OR ALLOW A CALLBACK FUNCTION TO BE PASSED IN AND RAN AS DYNAMIC LUA CODE:
		remote.call('muppet_streamer', 'run_command', 'muppet_streamer_spawn_around_player', {target=player.name, entityName="custom", customEntityName="big-worm-turret", force="muppet_streamer_enemy", radiusMax=15, radiusMin=10, existingEntities="avoid", quantity=3, onCompletionFunction="function(things) for _, thing in pairs(things) do thing.health = 100 end end"})
    - Optional settings should allow `nil` to be passed in as a supported value. Just to make managing multiple commands clearer, rather than having to remove non populated settings in object tables entirely.


Future Confirmed (bigger things):
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room. Should never be "lost".
	- Change all effect notification game.print's to just print to all connected players on the target's team. Help make the commands more multi team friendly.



Future Possible Concepts:
    - "Starting With Ghosts" affects all forces. Maybe we should only apply it to a force when a player joins that force. As can show up odd stuff in map editor and "may" affect other mods and scripted events if they expect to use bots to build script generated ghosts at set times, rather than replacing dead stuff as well.
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Spawn around player to support biters, spitters or both. Allow named or evolution specific.
    - Call for Help - add:
        - If player is in a vehicle try to put the called player in the vehicle with them first. If they are in a train try and put the players in other carriages in the train first.
        - An option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Spider's brain fish is on a fish-ion:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
		- either spider player is in or random one on the map. if random announce it.
        - lock player in spider (option)
        - option: spider keeps on walk towards a random location within a set radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: spider goes in search of water and/or fish.
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking). - use some sort of back off when damaged.
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (use teleport to nearest biter logic). - use some sort of back off when damaged.
    - Change player (named or all) characters to other things, i.e. biters. Need to check how armor, ammo, etc handles this. Also would need to be delayed until after other active event has finished.
    - Custom grenade, cluster grenade and nuke:
        - Requested by eoraptor666 (BigMonD).
        - Mod options for the custom:
            - Grenade:
                - Damage amount
                - Damage radius
            - Cluster Grenade:
                - Cluster count
                - Distance of spread
            - Nuke:
                - not requested, but would need max blast area and damage settable?
    - A New feature to ensure a player has a vehicle.
        - Support cars, spiders and locomotive vehicle types being placed in valid spots within a random distance from the player. Ideally have it find and use a larger clear area within the radius.
        - Support settings for ammo and fuel, types and quantities being in the vehicle.
        - Have this feature support checking if a nearby vehicle is drivable first, option to use the vehicle if its driver is free and top it up to the fuel and ammo standard.
        - Have it take an optional duration before removing the vehicle.
    - Spawn Around Player - Support electric turrets and giving them power. You can't directly set power in to things and most electric turrets have a tiny power buffer. Due to how power poles connect and power other forces the solution would be quite convoluted, this is just a guess and assumes we can connect 2 things by wire beyond their native wire reach distance:
        - Add a power pole to the game with near 0 power range and 0 power wire reach/count. Make a power pole on another surface with an electric energy interface, as we can set the starting electric on this. Link a wire via script between the 0 reach power pole on the turret and the power pole by the energy interface on the other surface. We now have a finite power source for that specific turret that won't power anything else. If we remove it all on the turrets death then nothing else should manage to get on that exact spot and thus be able to connect to the power network.
