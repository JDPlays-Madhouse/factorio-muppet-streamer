TODO:
	- flamethrower doesn't always move weapons out of the way, maybe to do with filtering?
	- If it clears a filter or moves a weapon/ammo, have it put the filter and weapon + ammo back afterwards.
	- check all abilities handle dead players nicely. giving stuff should go in their corpse inventory or on the ground.
	- add option to give extra copy of weapon or just ensure they have 1. Meak readme really clear. Also make option for if ammo is added and or just topped up.

Future:
	- Add option to set the force of placed entities, default to player.
    - add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Agrresive Train Driver:
        - Commands to lock the player in the train and force forwards driving for a set time period.
        - Steering Options:
            - Player can steer
            - Random steering by mod
            - No steering
        - Option to teleport player to a random train within X tiles
    - Call for Help:
        - for arrival radius
        - percent of online players/hard count of players
        - some way to list explicitly excluded or included named players
        - an option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Spider Fish Brain:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
        - lock player in spider
        - option: spider walks tor random location within radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking).
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (just search at run time ....).
    - Way to teleport to nearest biter nest:
        - Should take any vehicle you are in with you (option).
        - Option to take the train/carriage you are in with you (create the wagon on the ground with tiny bit of free rail)
        - Option for closeness to teleport.
        - Option for safe area to arrive in.
        - Do pathfinder check to make sure biter base is reachable from arrive spot.
        - Option to make sure biter base is patchable from spawn (avoids islands).
        - Option to do it to nearest enemy unit group, rather than biter base.
        - Once this is done re-use bits to make a smart random teleport option with similar safety check options.

Long Term:
	- the code doesn't handle trees being removed after the game starts. you could try wiping the cached data from the mods global. Will probably work, but do at your own risk. global.UTILITYBIOMETREES
