TODO:
    - If in a train and try to teleport it just fails.
    - Teleport to a specific position has to be revealed or it fails.

Future:
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
	- Leaky Flamethrower doesn't always move weapons out of the way, maybe to do with filtering?
	- If Leaky Flamethrower clears a filter or moves a weapon/ammo, have it put the filter and weapon + ammo back afterwards if available.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room.
    - Spawn around player to support biters, spitters or both. Allow named or evo specific.
    - Call for Help - add:
        - named player list of players to explicitly excluded or included.
        - an option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
