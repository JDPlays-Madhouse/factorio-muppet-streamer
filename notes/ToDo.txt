DOING NOW:
    - Make sure anything that monitors biter nests or teleports to enemies handles non default enemy forces and will respect cease fires/allies and thus target a further away true enemy base.

BUGS:
    - If another player is in train then "flooring it" doesn't force speed in some cases. Seen when other player is in loco and streamer is in a random wagon. But there may be other cases as well.
	- Leaky Flamethrower doesn't move filtered weapons out of the way. https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/6039c2cd2ea185676222f064
	- If Leaky Flamethrower clears a filter or moves a weapon/ammo, have it put the filter and weapon + ammo back afterwards if available.


Future Confirmed:
    - Support modded entities across commands.
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
    - Update to new Utils library.
    - The INTEGER type arguments will accept a double, but this will fail/error when trying to be used. They should really check for a type Integer. New Utility library version has functions to validate types of numbers.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room. Should never be "lost".


Future Concepts:
	- Inventory Shuffle - have it cancel the players crafting queue and shuffle those items as well. To avoid inventory spilling do after the initial inventory empty and check that it isn't going to fill up if the player has some ridiclious crafting queue, i.e. chunk the cancelling?
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Spawn around player to support biters, spitters or both. Allow named or evo specific.
    - Call for Help - add:
        - If player is in a vehicle try to put the called player in the vehicle with them first. If they are in a train try and put the players in other carriages in the train first.
        - An option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Aggressive driver to control a spidertron with similar effects to how it does cars.
    - Spider Fish on a Mish-ion:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
		- either spider player is in or random one on the map. if random announce it.
        - lock player in spider (option)
        - option: spider keeps on walk towards a random location within a set radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking).
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (use teleport to nearest biter logic).
    - Change player (named or all) characters to other things, i.e. biters. Need to check how armour, ammo, etc handles this. Also would need to be delayed until after other active event has finished.
