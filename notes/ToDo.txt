DOING NOW:


BUGS:
    - Call For Help: Mass player moving often puts a few inside each other (i.e. 2 out of 10). All the others were placed spaced out. This happens as with multiple arriving players, each one starts the process sequentially, but the wait for pathfinder results makes them all become asyncronous. So in effect all players look for an empty spot randomly near the target, then they start the pathfinder wait. So if 2 players both randomly select the same spot (or overlapping spots) the first one hasn't reserved it in any way until their pathfinder returns later, so the second player also see's it as free. With vehicles involved this will be worse. Simpliest way is to have it repeat the placement check post pathfinder for each incomming player and if it fails do a free retry, as this should be a very rare edge case.
    - Telepeort: If being done with the reachableOnly option enabled, in theory the target location may become blocked while the pathfinder is running, and then assuming the path is found the command will move the player there anyway. Simpliest way is to have it repeat the placement check post pathfinder and if it fails do a free retry, as this should be a very rare edge case.
    - Teleport: what happens if the target player is dead, as they can;t be teleported then. It should fail gracefully and quickly for this. Needs to check after each pathfinder loop.
    - Call For Help: check all the references (entities, surface, etc) being passed around for the players being called in after each pathfinder loop are all still valid. If players started to be teleported to one place we want the others to continue going there, but we need to avoid edge cases of surfaces being deleted or target player vehicles vanishing during pathfinder loops as this may cause crashs.
    - Teleport and Call For Help: if a player changes in to a vehicle with a larger collision box than when the path finder started it may well place it in an invalid spot. So it needs to repeat the validity check at the end of a successful pathfinder and restart the process if the vehicle has changed from expected and DOESN'T fit in the location found already.


DO NEAR FUTURE:
    - Add an interface to Explosive Delivery. Initally for calling by the JD Plays mod- Spider hunt feature, for the battleships idea that we want to contain within JD's map lane. IDEA ON HOLD.
	- Change all game.print's to just print to all connected players on the target's team. Help make the commands more multi team friendly.


Future Confirmed (bigger things):
    - Support modded entities across commands.
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
    - Update to new Utils library. Will get some fixes & UPS improvements, but also will get al the EmmyLua improvements and move to new structure of library.
    - The INTEGER type arguments will accept a double, but this will fail/error when trying to be used. They should really check for a type Integer. New Utility library version has functions to validate types of numbers.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room. Should never be "lost".


Future Concepts:
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Spawn around player to support biters, spitters or both. Allow named or evo specific.
    - Call for Help - add:
        - If player is in a vehicle try to put the called player in the vehicle with them first. If they are in a train try and put the players in other carriages in the train first.
        - An option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Aggressive driver to control a spidertron with similar effects to how it does cars.
    - Spider's brain fish is on a fish-ion:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
		- either spider player is in or random one on the map. if random announce it.
        - lock player in spider (option)
        - option: spider keeps on walk towards a random location within a set radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: spider goes in search of water and/or fish.
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking). - use some sort of back off when damaged.
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (use teleport to nearest biter logic). - use some sort of back off when damaged.
    - Change player (named or all) characters to other things, i.e. biters. Need to check how armour, ammo, etc handles this. Also would need to be delayed until after other active event has finished.
    - Custom grenade, cluster grenade and nuke:
        - Requested by eoraptor666 (BigMonD).
        - Mod options for the custom:
            - Grenade:
                - Damage amount
                - Damage radius
            - Cluster Grenade:
                - Cluster count
                - Distance of spread
            - Nuke:
                - not requested, but would need max blast area and damage settable?
        - Callable from the Explosive Delivery.
    - Leaky flamethrower doesn't support non vanilla flamethrower weapons or ammos. It relies upon the vanilla shooting speed and ammo count per item.
