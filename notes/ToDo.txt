TODO:

Future:
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
	- Flamethrower doesn't always move weapons out of the way, maybe to do with filtering?
	- If it clears a filter or moves a weapon/ammo, have it put the filter and weapon + ammo back afterwards.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room.
    - Call for Help:
        - set arrival radius
        - set max distance to call players from
        - quantity of players to call (specify both and get the max of the 2)
        - ratio of currently online players to call (specify both and get the max of the 2)
        - named player list of players to explicitly excluded or included.
        - an option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Spider Fish Brain:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
        - lock player in spider
        - option: spider keeps on walk towards a random location within a set radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking).
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (use teleport to nearest biter logic).
    - Teleport:
        - Target: random, biter nest (track nest creation and destruction)
        - Minimum distance to teleport
        - Maximum distance to teleport
        - Should take any vehicle you are in with you (option).
        - Option to take the train/carriage you are in with you (create the wagon on the ground with tiny bit of free rail)
        - Do pathfinder check to make sure biter base is reachable from arrive spot.
        - If target is biter nest:
            - Option for closeness to teleport.
            - Option for safe area to arrive in.
            - Option to make sure biter base is patchable from spawn (avoids islands).
        - Option to do it to nearest enemy unit group, rather than biter base if UPS friendly.

Long Term:
	- the code doesn't handle trees being removed after the game starts. you could try wiping the cached data from the mods global. Will probably work, but do at your own risk. global.UTILITYBIOMETREES
