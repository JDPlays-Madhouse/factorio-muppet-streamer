DOING NOW:
    - Player inventory mixup - Takes all of the inventory and gear from named or all players and re-distributes them across the same players.
        - Will get the total count of each item type and the number of player sources each item type came from.
        - Then distributing back a reasonable chunk to a random percentage of source player count and randoming the rest between all players in chunks (maybe weighted towards the players who already received some). This should ensure a somewhat distribution back based on what came in, while avoiding a boring equal spread across everyone or a complete concentration of all of an item type in to just 1 player. i.e.
            - all 5 players have between 1 and 2 machine guns each = 4 players would get 1 machine gun each plus some would have 1 or 2 extra (random part). The 4 players is the random receiving players (down from starting number here).
            - 2 of 5 players have 50 and 250 inserters = 3 players would get inserters each. Some random chance of the extra inserters being spread (in random chunk sizes) across those 3 players or to the other 2 players.  The 3 players who will definitely get inserters is randomly up from the starting player count with that item.

BUGS:
    - If another player is in train then "flooring it" doesn't force speed in some cases. Seen when other player is in loco and streamer is in a random wagon. But there may be other cases as well.
	- Leaky Flamethrower doesn't move filtered weapons out of the way. https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/6039c2cd2ea185676222f064
	- If Leaky Flamethrower clears a filter or moves a weapon/ammo, have it put the filter and weapon + ammo back afterwards if available.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room. Should never be "lost".
    - Many of the NUMBER arguments will accept a double, but this will fail/error when trying to be used. They should really for a type Integer and the readme should list this. Brief note added to readme in mean time. New Utility library version has functions to validate types of numbers.


Future:
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
    - Spawn around player to support biters, spitters or both. Allow named or evo specific.
	- Spawn around player turrets to have "best researched" ammo option in addition to the named ammos. There may be other sensible options around this.
    - Call for Help - add:
        - If player is in a vehicle try to put the called player in the vehicle with them first. If they are in a train try and put the players in other carriages in the train first.
        - an option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Spider Fish on a Mish-ion:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
		- either spider player is in or random one on the map. if random announce it.
        - lock player in spider (option)
        - option: spider keeps on walk towards a random location within a set radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking).
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (use teleport to nearest biter logic).
    - Change player (named or all) characters to other things, i.e. biters. Need to check how armour, ammo, etc handles this. Also would need to be delayed until after other active event has finished.
