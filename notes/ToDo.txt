DOING NOW:
    - Check that calling Teleport when a player is in a train works.
	- Check if Teleport walkable check doesn't work with some of the target types as the readme implies this. If so I don't know why it doesn't, add a note to say why if not resolvable.
    - Pants on fire doesn't set trees on fire, looks to be lack of initial_ground_flame_count and my other default is 250, but have a play with it.


BUGS:
    - If another player is in train then "flooring it" doesn't force speed in some cases. Seen when other player is in loco and streamer is in a random wagon. But there may be other cases as well.
	- Leaky Flamethrower doesn't move filtered weapons out of the way. https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/6039c2cd2ea185676222f064
	- If Leaky Flamethrower clears a filter or moves a weapon/ammo, have it put the filter and weapon + ammo back afterwards if available.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room. Should never be "lost".


Future:
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
    - Spawn around player to support biters, spitters or both. Allow named or evo specific.
    - Call for Help - add:
        - If player is in a vehicle try to put the called player in the vehicle with them first. If they are in a train try and put the players in other carriages in the train first.
        - named player list of players to explicitly excluded or included.
        - an option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Spider Fish on a Mish-ion:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
		- either spider player is in or random one on the map. if random announce it.
        - lock player in spider (option)
        - option: spider keeps on walk towards a random location within a set radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking).
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (use teleport to nearest biter logic).
    - Change player (named or all) characters to other things, i.e. biters. Need to check how armour, ammo, etc handles this. Also would need to be delayed until after other active event has finished.
