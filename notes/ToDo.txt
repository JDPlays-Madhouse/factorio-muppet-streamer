DOING NOW:
    - SpawnAroundPlayer - entityTypeDetails should be stored as a name of the object of functions and not the object of functions itself. As its not save/load safe to store the object of functions. This is what caused the error for me and Fox, but no one else. As we joined at the wrong moment.

	- Up the pants on fire to 50 flames as this makes trees catch on fire much easier as you run past. Readme already updated.
	- Cap the pants on fire and spawn around player fire values at 250, as 255 seems to be buggy within Factorio. https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=103227
	- Teleport "Depth" warning/error message missing spacing:     COMMAND - argument 'reachableOnly at depth 1 - ' reachableOnly setting is populated ....


BUGS:
    - Suspect Aggressive Driver ignores vehicles that don't burn any fuel. As it just checks if there is currently fuel and ignores if it needs fuel. Probably need the utility function that gets fuel to also return if the entity needs fuel (has a burner).
	- Make Remote Interface calls return the things they create if appropriate. Means you can chain them together in a Lua script. This should just need the odd entry in a features "notes" and an entry in the generic Remote Interface section to check each command. For affected players it should return the players who were/are affected, i.e. if a player isn't affected by aggressive driver then nil is return, rather than the LuaPlayer object.
	- Invalid player name warning, should include that the player isn't currently on the server or has never been on the server. Applies to all commands.



DO NEAR FUTURE:
    - Add to Spawn Around Player a min and max remain time. Both optional. If set added entities will vanish after a random time between them.
    - Add to allow other items to be inserted in to custom entities created. Let customSecondaryDetail be used for any item type when the main entity type can have it "inserted" : container/chests, furnace, assembling-machine, vehicles. The ammoCount can still set the number of things. Include an example of spawning a tank with some fuel in it. This will be enough for the fireplace modded entity to be used. This should also support electricity in to energy turrets and fluids in to fluid-turrets.
	- Allow the messages to be turned off per command. Good for when being used on many players at once.



Future Confirmed (bigger things):
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room. Should never be "lost".
	- Change all effect notification game.print's to just print to all connected players on the target's team. Help make the commands more multi team friendly.



Future Possible Concepts:
    - "Starting With Ghosts" affects all forces. Maybe we should only apply it to a force when a player joins that force. As can show up odd stuff in map editor and "may" affect other mods and scripted events if they expect to use bots to build script generated ghosts at set times, rather than replacing dead stuff as well.
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Spawn around player to support biters, spitters or both. Allow named or evolution specific.
    - Call for Help - add:
        - If player is in a vehicle try to put the called player in the vehicle with them first. If they are in a train try and put the players in other carriages in the train first.
        - An option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Spider's brain fish is on a fish-ion:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
		- either spider player is in or random one on the map. if random announce it.
        - lock player in spider (option)
        - option: spider keeps on walk towards a random location within a set radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: spider goes in search of water and/or fish.
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking). - use some sort of back off when damaged.
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (use teleport to nearest biter logic). - use some sort of back off when damaged.
    - Change player (named or all) characters to other things, i.e. biters. Need to check how armor, ammo, etc handles this. Also would need to be delayed until after other active event has finished.
    - Custom grenade, cluster grenade and nuke:
        - Requested by eoraptor666 (BigMonD).
        - Mod options for the custom:
            - Grenade:
                - Damage amount
                - Damage radius
            - Cluster Grenade:
                - Cluster count
                - Distance of spread
            - Nuke:
                - not requested, but would need max blast area and damage settable?
    - A New feature to ensure a player has a vehicle.
        - Support cars, spiders and locomotive vehicle types being placed in valid spots within a random distance from the player. Ideally have it find and use a larger clear area within the radius.
        - Support settings for ammo and fuel, types and quantities being in the vehicle.
        - Have this feature support checking if a nearby vehicle is drivable first, option to use the vehicle if its driver is free and top it up to the fuel and ammo standard.
        - Have it take an optional duration before removing the vehicle.
