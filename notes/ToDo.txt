DOING NOW:
    - Do all the inline TODO's.
    - The INTEGER type arguments will accept a double, but this will fail/error when trying to be used. They should really check for a type Integer. New Utility library version has functions to validate types of numbers. This means replacing the current command paramater handling code to use the better libraries.

    - Once Sumneko 3.5 comes out we can add opreator to uint for add and then a lot of the --[[@as]] should be removable. Also maybe our generics math library will be more viable...
    - Unknown is being accepted as anything. Think this should be flagged as warning. Spawn aroud player - forceString. Asked in discussion: https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/discussions/1333


BUGS:


DO NEAR FUTURE:
    - Add a remote interface to Explosive Delivery. Initally for calling by the JD Plays mod- Spider hunt feature, for the battleships idea that we want to contain within JD's map lane. IDEA ON HOLD.
	- Change all effect notification game.print's to just print to all connected players on the target's team. Help make the commands more multi team friendly.


Future Confirmed (bigger things):
    - Support modded entities across commands.
    - Time duration events should add to existing ones if active.
	- Giving stuff to a dead player should go in to their corpse inventory or on the ground if no room. Should never be "lost".


Future Concepts:
    - Add effects radiating from player in all directions: various tank shells, shotgun shells, flamethrower
    - Spawn around player to support biters, spitters or both. Allow named or evo specific.
    - Call for Help - add:
        - If player is in a vehicle try to put the called player in the vehicle with them first. If they are in a train try and put the players in other carriages in the train first.
        - An option to weight the player selection by time online. - this may be multiple options, see discussion: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/muppet_streamer/discussion/5f7b1102057852611e5817c6
    - Aggressive driver to control a spidertron with similar effects to how it does cars.
    - Spider's brain fish is on a fish-ion:
        - spiders need a fish as their brain, sometimes they gain control.
        - for set time period
		- either spider player is in or random one on the map. if random announce it.
        - lock player in spider (option)
        - option: spider keeps on walk towards a random location within a set radius
        - option: spider walks randomly around
        - option: spider goes in search of water and/or fish.
        - option: walk towards nearest biter base (use teleport biter nest tracking). - use some sort of back off when damaged.
        - option: walk towards nearest enemy unit group (use teleport to nearest biter logic). - use some sort of back off when damaged.
    - Change player (named or all) characters to other things, i.e. biters. Need to check how armour, ammo, etc handles this. Also would need to be delayed until after other active event has finished.
    - Custom grenade, cluster grenade and nuke:
        - Requested by eoraptor666 (BigMonD).
        - Mod options for the custom:
            - Grenade:
                - Damage amount
                - Damage radius
            - Cluster Grenade:
                - Cluster count
                - Distance of spread
            - Nuke:
                - not requested, but would need max blast area and damage settable?
        - Callable from the Explosive Delivery.
    - Leaky flamethrower doesn't support non vanilla flamethrower weapons or ammos. It relies upon the vanilla shooting speed and ammo count per item.
